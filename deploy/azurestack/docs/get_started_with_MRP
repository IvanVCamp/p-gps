# Getting Started with Parts Unlimited MRP

As mentioned in the previous steps, Parts Unlimited MRP is a fictional outsourced Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) application for training purposes based on the description in chapters 31-35 of The Phoenix Projectby Gene Kim, Kevin Behr and George Spafford. © 2013 IT Revolution Press LLC, Portland, OR. Resemblance to “Project Unicorn” in the novel is intentional; resemblance to any real company is purely coincidental.

The application uses entirely open source software including Linux, Java, Apache, and MongoDB which creates a web front end, an order service, and an integration service.

As part of the deployment, you'll have the opportunity to embrace a number of core DevOps practices, along with experiencing a number of different open source technologies.

### Key Features
- Front end service - runs Apache Tomcat and talks to order service
- Order and Integration service - runs Java and calls MongoDB
- Integration service - present to integrate with Parts Unlimited Website
- Includes a Dockerfile and sample publishing profile to publish to a Docker container
- Includes Azure RM JSON templates and PowerShell automation scripts to easily build and provision your environment

### Fundamentals
- Infrastructure as Code - (IaC)
- Continuous Integration - (CI)
- Continuous Deployment - (CD)
- Configuration Management - (CM)

As time moves forward, more documents will be added that support additonal DevOps practices, going beyond the fundamentals and exploring more advanced techniques and tools.
