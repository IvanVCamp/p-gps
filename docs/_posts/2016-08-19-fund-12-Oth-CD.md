### Tasks Overview:
During the following tasks you will fork the PartsUnlimitedMRP github repository and create a Jenkins pipeline for the Continous Integration of the Parts Unlimited MRP application. You will learn how to configure Jenkins so that whenever a change is checked in on the code repository, a build will be triggered and several tests will be performed.

Next steps
----------

In this lab, you learned how to create a Continuous Integration build that runs when new commits are pushed to the master branch. This allows you to get feedback as to whether your changes made breaking syntax changes, or if they broke one or more automated tests, or if your changes are okay. Try these lab out for next steps:
